# StochasticProcessR
Exercises from the Introduction to Stochastic Processes with R by Robert P. Dobrow in R and in Python.

## Looking at the notebooks
You can look at the results of the notebooks by opening them on the browser as they are in git, but be aware that the results might change formating, for better visualization you can clone or download this repository and open the notebooks using your prefered notebook editor. 

## Progress
Right now I only have the first two chapters completed in both languages, I believe the results are correct, but you should check them just in case when downloading the exercises, if you find errors please open an issue and I will fix it as soon as possible. I will be updating constantly while finishing the 9 chapters of the book. 

Hope this helps you in any way :D
